This is my Python (programming) portfolio for my Senior year (2020-2021)— specifically my 2021 portfolio.<br>
<hr>
🗶 Things in this portfolio include:<br>
  &nbsp;🗶 ↝ A Tile-Based Topdown Zombie Shooter ( PROJECT NAME: python__tile_based_game | PROGRAMMED WITH: Python 3.x & Pygame )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;🗶 ↺ ↝ This Topdwon Shooter is customized with hand-picked music and sounds— I am planning on expanding upon this shooter (i.e. I want to add more kinds of weaponry, and maybe even add an inventory and more kinds of health packs.)<br>
  &nbsp;🗶 ↝  A Cute, Simple Platformer ( PROJECT NAME: python__simple_platformer_game | PROGRAMMED WITH: Python 3.x & Pygame )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;🗶 ↺ ↝ This cute, simple platformer is just that, a simple platformer. I am planning on adding enimies once you get a certain number of points along with upgrades/powerups.
  &nbsp;🗶 ↝ A Space Shooter / Shmup ( PROJECT NAME: pygame__shmup1 | PROGRAMMED WITH: Python 3.8  & Pygame )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;🗶 ↺ ↝ This Shmup game allows the player to obtain upgrades/powerups with a variety of things... As well as having little aliens that will fall out of the asteroids; the little aliens will also give you a special suprise when hit by the player's rocket ship.<br>
  &nbsp;🗶 ↝ A Machine Learning Experiment that utilizes the Pytorch library ( PROJECT NAME: machine_learning_experiment__pytorch | PROGRAMMED WITH: Python 3.x & Pytorch )<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;🗶 ↺ ↝ This Machine Learning Experiment is meant to predict school grades, and I plan on implementing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will allow the user to "plug in" thier own current school grades, along with past school grades and data; this will allow the user to predict their own (and/or others) school grades.
